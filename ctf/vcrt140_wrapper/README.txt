A solution for a Windows reversing chall involving the use of a vcruntime140.dll wrapper (generated courtesy of https://github.com/mavenlin/wrap_dll) as a DLL injection vector, which means you can simply drop the resulting DLL in the same directory as the .exe for it to load and execute early.

Contains multiple anti-debug circumvention mechanisms/methods (PEB, inline hooking, and runtime patches) with proper logging, as well as solving the challenge that involves extracting and decrypting credentials from virtualized code.

Note that since we're wrapping the VC runtime DLL, initialization of some C++ std classes such as std::vector inside the wrapper's DllMain(), will fail, causing a stack overflow, which is the reason why dynamically allocated arrays are used, instead, throughout the code.
